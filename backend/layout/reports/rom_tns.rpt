**WARN: (IMPEXT-3493):	The design extraction status has been reset by set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner or set_db  command. The parasitic data can be regenerated either by extracting the design using the extract_rc command or by loading the SPEF or RCDB file(s). To prevent resetting of the extraction status, avoid changing extraction modes.
Type 'man IMPEXT-3493' for more detail.
**WARN: (IMPOPT-7139):	'set_db extract_rc_coupled false' has been implicitly activated since current delay calulation is under SIAware false mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'set_design_mode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for post_route (extract_rc_effort_level low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'rom_chip' of instances=237 and nets=284 using extraction engine 'post_route' at effort level 'low' .
post_route (extract_rc_effort_level low) RC Extraction called for design rom_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(2) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6166):	Capacitance table file(s) without the EXTENDED section is being used for RC extraction. This is not recommended because it results in lower accuracy for clock nets in pre_route extraction and for all nets in post_route extraction using extract_rc_effort_level low. Regenerate capacitance table file(s) using the write_cap_table command.
